Sanity check is a simple test that checks for obvious errors.<br>

### Solution:

In order to pass the sanity check, you can directly do what the description says.

Recall that the name of the challenge is "sanity check" but reversed, so do the same by _reversing the image around the center point_.

That is just another way to say _rotate the image by 180Â°_.

(The image shows the text "flag: corctf{}")
