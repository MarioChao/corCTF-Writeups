# Welcome

Hi everybody.<br>
I'm MarioChao, also known as Panicks28.

I don't have much experiences in cybersecurity, but I did do a lot of competitive programming.<br>
Thus, _crypto_ is the most convenient section for me to start off.


This folder contains my experiences on several challenges encountered in [Crusaders of Rust's CTF](https://ctf.cor.team/)!
